# StellarOS: a 1MB lightweight fork of Android
***For kids and for everyone!***

StellarOS is a port-to-anywhere flavor of Android that can run on literally anything, like the Doom of Android flavors. Everything you need to boot it is in a 1-megabyte `.jar` or `.wasm` boot file.

## StellarBook
The StellarBook is a $20 pocket computer, portable to everything (but especially the Nintendo DS), that helps kids save up for what really matters in their lives.

Setup is easy--as soon as it boots, the computer opens to Home, where **Kya the Friendly Crow-Demon** greets them. She offers to leave if they've got everything mastered already, but if they choose for her to stay, she will excitedly guide the user through setup and owning their very own computer.

Everything is meant **for kids**. Parental controls are nearly impossible to set up and require the parent to solve a literal maze.

## Pages
The desktop GUI is divided into four pages: Home, Play, Work, and My Computer. Each relies mainly on an intuitive system of icons and graphic elements to communicate what the user is supposed to do there, but also has written labels to clear things up. This will make the OS easily localizable.
